        This file is used to load every asset that is necessary for running tests
        for particular toolkit, barring the test specs themselves. We do that
        in order to share as much as possible between different test runners:
        local, Cmd, and Orion.
        
        The list of scripts below should include:
            - Test scaffold and necessary 3rd party libs (Jasmine, JSON2, etc)
            - Ext bootstrap appropriate for the toolkit (ext-debug.js or ext-modern-debug.js)
            - Theme overrides appropriate for the toolkit. Loader will wait for the classes
              not yet available.
            - Utility and initialization scripts, either shared between toolkits or
              specific to the toolkit this reporter will be testing
        
        This list should NOT include:
            - Either individual test spec files or bootstrapper that will load them.
              Specs will be loaded by the test runner. For the local runner, the list
              of files to load is provided in the main index.html
            - Any scripts or code that is specific to the runner. This includes Cmd
              stuff like cmd.js and cmd-jasmine.js
            - Any code that kicks off the actual test run. It is runner's responsibility
              to do that.
