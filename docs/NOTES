Modern seismic networks are designed to support the communication of ground motion data between analog sensors and digital computers. ocmmuniaground motion into digital machine-readable sequences to central archiving facilities for storage.

Each observation made by a senso
Most seismic data is sent to central datacenters like the DMC for .
Seismic signals are measured, recorded, and transmitt

Modern seismic networks are local, regional, and global in nature.

Geophysical data are recorded by an instrument that imparts its own signature onto the data.
